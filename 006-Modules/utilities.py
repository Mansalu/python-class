    Function that solves a given quadratic equation for X. 
    Accepts constant coefficients a, b, and c. Returns two values
    x1 and x2, where x1 is always the smaller value of the two.
    
    Recall that a quadratic is an equation that can be reduced to the form

    y = ax^2+bx+c

    Also recall the quadratic equation
    x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 -4ac)) / (2a)
