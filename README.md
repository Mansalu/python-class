# Python Class

An introduction to beginner programming with the Python language. The class is divided into short lecture/demos where a single concept is introduced (ie variables or loops).
The concept is applied via a creative programming assignment, which is sometimes directed. Finally a short concept quiz about the previous section is presented at the beginning of each session.
