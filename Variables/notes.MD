# Variables, Types, and Console I/O

## Running code in the terminal

Run the our program by typing 

    python main.py

## Printing to the console and Reading console input

`print()` can be called to have Python output to the terminal/console

Strings of text in python are surrouned by quotes " "

`input()` can be called to read typed input from the console/terminal

## Variable Assignment

In python, '=' is the assignment operator. It is used to assign a value to a variable.

    myVariable = 55

You can also assign a string of text in python to a variable 

    myString = "a string of text"

### Examples

-Print a string of text

    print("Hello World")

-Print the value stored in the variable called myVar

    print(myVar)

-Assign a string to a variable named myStr

    myStr = "Some text"

-Assign terminal/console input to a variable named userInput

    userInput = input()

-Prompt the user for their name and save the input to a variable called usersName

    usersName = input("Please enter your first name: ")

**Basic Operators in Python**
+, -, *, /, <, >, ==, !=, <=, >=, =

**Beware the difference between the '=' operator and the '==' operator**

'==' is the equality operator (asks the question "Are two values equal?")
'=' is the assignment operator (assign a value to a variable)
