# While Loops

# Define a counter for controlling the loop
count = 0

# Define a limit to loop up to
limit = 10

# Loop as long as count is less than limit
while (count < limit):
    # Increment count on each iteration of the loop
    count += 1
    # If count is even print it
    if (count % 2 == 0):
        print(count)
